# SentinelOne Jupyter Notebooks

The following Jupyter notebooks were created to simplify interacting with the SentinelOne Console API. The notebooks are broken up by their ultimate functions: Management, Hunting, Investigations. These are still a work in progress, I'm still new to Jupyter notebooks and using Pandas, so these may change as frequently as the SentinelOne API ;)

## Current Notebooks
* SentinelOne Management Notebook - Console, Agent, Policy and Exclusion information.
* SentinelOne Hunt Notebook - Threat investigation and Deep Visibility hunting.
* SentinelOne Investigate Notebook - Incident response/forensic notebook.

## Planned Notebooks 
* SentinelOne Automated Hunts - Creates saved DV queries, executes and exports the query data, then performs data review and output. (May need to be broken down into Tactics and Techniques)
